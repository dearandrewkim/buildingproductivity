        <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>My name is Andrew Kim, the author of the <strong>Building Productivity</strong> Blog.</p>
<p>I'm a client-side project manager in construction working in Melbourne, Australia. I'm interested in the cross-section between <strong>construction, technology and productivity</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Technology has been a big part of my childhood, education and career.</strong> When I was in primary school, I made geo-cities websites using pure HTML and CSS using windows notepad. (I once made one website about cats with bubbles floating down in the background with xylophone midi background music). I still enjoy developing websites to this day but using a bit more modern tool.</p>
<p>At University, I studied both architecture and engineering. There was an expectation for you to be proficient with all software. For architecture, I've pulled all-nighters trying to 3D model unrealistic floating buildings. I've spent a lot of time designing posters to try to please my tutors (who were always still critical regardless of what you do). For engineering, we created intense spreadsheets to determine structural design compliance with the Australian Standards.</p>
<p>I am a product of this generation. I have grown up with computers, smartphones, and adapting to upcoming technology.</p>
<p>I've been a project manager in both government and private sectors, delivering construction projects. I've been using technology to be more efficient and productive. This has taken in form of personal tasks as well as leading organisational change in adopting new software.</p>
<p><strong>Time and time again, I see that a lot of people want to improve their technical literacy so that they can be more efficient at work. But they don't know where to start. A lot of the time they just give up.</strong></p>
<p>In this blog, I would like to share some tech tips as a construction project manager so that you can build productivity both at work and at home.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading my blog!</p>
